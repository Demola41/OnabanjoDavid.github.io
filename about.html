									<h1>HI! I'M<br />
									Onabanjo David</h1>
									<p>A data analyst with a background in biomedical laboratory science. I work at the intersection of data, healthcare, and business, where structured analysis can directly influence real-world decisions.</p>
								</header>
								<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img class="pot" src="images/Potrait.png" alt="Portrait" width="40%"/>
</div>
								<p>I currently build analytics projects using Power BI, Excel, and SQL, focusing on transforming raw datasets into insights that explain what is happening, why it is happening, and what actions can be taken next. I am particularly interested in analyses related to operations, customer behavior, and performance measurement.

I enjoy data visualization because it forces clarity. While I am actively learning advanced techniques, I believe strong fundamentals, clean data, and clear questions matter more than flashy methods, which doesn't mean dashboards can't look good and also be efficient.

I am also developing my skills in data analytics and healthcare-related data analysis, with the long-term goal of becoming a healthcare data analyst. With a foundation in biomedical laboratory science, I bring a unique perspective to data analysis, particularly in healthcare contexts. My experience in laboratory settings has honed my attention to detail and understanding of complex data sets, which I now apply to uncovering insights that drive informed decision-making.</p>
								<h2>Education & Technical Background</h2>
								<p>I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Medical Laboratory Science from Babcock University, where I graduated with a second-class upper degree. My academic training provided a strong foundation in data interpretation, laboratory processes, quality control, and scientific reasoning.

My final-year research focused on the immunomodulatory effects of ginger on hematological parameters in an experimental model, which strengthened my ability to work with structured data, interpret results critically, and communicate findings clearly.

In addition to my formal education, I actively develop my technical skills through hands-on projects and self-directed learning in data analytics.</p>

								<h2>Interests & Beyond Work</h2>
								<p>Beyond my professional interests, I am passionate about continuous learning and personal growth. I enjoy keeping up with healthcare trends to stay updated with the latest developments in this fields. Outside of work, I am interested in personal development, fitness, and building sustainable routines. I value consistency, discipline, and continuous improvement, both professionally and personally.

I am open to junior data analyst roles, internships, and project-based opportunities, particularly in environments where learning, collaboration, and impact are prioritized.</p>
								
								<h2>Contact Me</h2>
								<p>If you would like to get in touch, please feel free to reach out via email at Onabanjo_ademola@yahoo.com or connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/onabanjo-david/" target="_blank" class="icon brands fa-linkedin">LinkedIn</a>. I am always open to discussing potential opportunities, collaborations, or simply exchanging ideas related to data analytics and healthcare.</p>
